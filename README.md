Security professionals use the Raspberry pi loaded with the powerful Kali Linux to exploit vulnerabilities in the network.  This is done connecting the Kali terminal armed with the Metasploit Framework via SSH to their mobile Device or laptop, in order to do this on a foreign network, they have to make an access point out of their router, connect to it with their SSH client, and SSH into their Raspberry pi, then connect to the network, however, connecting to the network can be just as confusing as it is inconvenient.  This script will make connecting to the network easy and efficient, all it needs is a wireless interface, network name, and password. This script is compatable with all Kali Linux platforms.
