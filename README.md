Security professionals use the Raspberry pi loaded with the powerful Kali Linux to exploit vulnerabilities in the network in a tiny package.  Sometimes, you will find yourself without a monitor and will need to use a CLI, however, connecting to the network can be confusing or inconvenient, this script will make you feel right at home, all it needs is an interface, ssid(network name), and password
<br>
Prerequisites:
<br>
  Root privilages (sudo)
<br>
  Kali Linux (I designed this script only for Kali Linux, you can try other Distros, but is not recommended if you want it to work)
<br>
To Setup:
<br>
  Clone repository (first navigate into whatever directory you want:)
